Brief Description: For this challenge, I refactored code to create an SVC model function. Once the model was trained, I created another function that takes in a text message and predicts whether it is "spam" or "not spam". Finally, I created a Gradio app to host the application and enable users to test whichever text message they want. The UI provides feedback whether the text message is spam or not. I tested 4 different messages to see the outputs. Two were categorized as "spam" and two as "not spam". I have included the script for google colab, and the script for VS code directly. I ran the code and tested this challenge on both platforms.
